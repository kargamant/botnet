# BotnetðŸ¤–
A custom FRIENDLY implementation of a botnet attack.

## Brief explanation of attack  
There are two malicious host types: bot_node and bot_master.  
Bot master must command bot nodes in some unsuspicious way to spam ARP requests on some target IP during given time.  

# Modules  

## bot_master  
This module is responsible for periodically sending broadcast packages in the following format.

As you can see, the package has regular ARP format, but instead of source IP it has target_ip and instead of target IP it has attack_time.  
The key identifier for bot_nodes is SHA which should be some secret bot_master MAC that was chosen before setting this software in network.  
Importantly, bot_master should be installed on one machine in the network, cause otherwise it will be quite suspicious behaviour or lead to missidentification of packages by bot_nodes.  

To run this module simply call it with following format:  
``` $ bot_master.exe "<NIC_adapter_name>" <target_ip> <attack_time> <timeout> ```  

## bot_node  
This module is listening for packages that bot_master sends. As soon as, the package is delivered bot_node compares source hardware address with chose bot_master MAC and extracts target_ip and attack_time.  
Afterwards, it starts to send ARP packages on target_ip within given attack_time. Importantly, if bot_master's timeout is less than attack_time, the attack will be performed until bot_master is shut down.  
When bot_master shuts down, bot_node finishes its last load of ARP packages and continue to listen.  

To run this module simply call it with following format:  
```$ bot_node.exe "<NIC_adapter_name>" ```  

## Build  
Currently only windows build is supported. The system is resolved automatically.  
``` $ make ```  

# Eperiment  
Botnet was tested with following, not very comlicated network with 3 hosts.  
![bot_net_experiment drawio (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829ed636-85db-4ddd-bc17-c8c568398ec8)  
The goal of the conducted experiment was to observe structure of bot_master packages and ARP spam from bot_node in wireshark on victim's pc.  
  
bot_node was listening on TPlink adapter with MAC as in the picture.  
```$ bot_node.exe "TPLINK usb adapter"```  
  
bot_master was sending packages with target_ip set to victim's machine IP, attack time 10 seconds and timeout period 5 seconds.  
```$ bot_master.exe "ASIX electron usb adapter" 192.168.0.33 10 5```
